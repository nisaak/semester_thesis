	abstract = {This paper introduces a computationally efficient, approach for obstacle detection in driving assistance applications, based on stereovision. The proposed approach involves three different steps aiming an increased quality of the results. The first step relies on the basics: obstacles correspond to peak regions in the u-disparity map. By applying the model of the stereo system, the peaks are detected with an adaptive threshold. The adaptive thresholding will calculate the accumulation of points required for an obstacle based on its distance (disparity) and will be related to the characteristics of the stereovision system. The second and third steps consist of refining the result of the previous, vertically respectively horizontally. This is necessary in order to fill out unmarked pixel regions which are classified as belonging to obstacles. The second step iterates vertically and propagates the obstacle label to neighbor pixels. The third step improves obstacle regions horizontally, with points that do not belong to the road. The solution is fast and reliable, on various scenarios, as every step is an improvement of the standard U-disparity approach for obstacle detection. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

@article{Hu2005,
	abstract = {Reliable understanding of the 3D driving environment is vital for obstacle detection and adaptive cruise control (ACC) applications. Laser or millimeter wave radars have shown good performance in measuring relative speed and distance in a highway driving environment. However the accuracy of these systems decreases in an urban traffic environment as more confusion occurs due to factors such as parked vehicles, guardrails, poles and motorcycles. A stereovision based sensing system provides an effective supplement to radar-based road scene analysis with its much wider field of view and more accurate lateral information. This paper presents an efficient solution using a stereovision based road scene analysis algorithm, which employs the "U-V-disparity" concept. This concept is used to classify a 3D road scene into relative surface planes and characterize the features of road pavement surfaces, roadside structures and obstacles. Real-time implementation of the disparity map calculation and the "U-V-disparity" classification is also presented.},

@article{Kakegawa2018,
	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a road surface segmenta-tion technique which is accurate and suitable for hardware implementation. The road surface is segmented by detecting the boundary between road and obstacle, based on the disparity histogram which we define as VLDH (Vertically Local Disparity Histogram). On each pixel of disparity image, VLDH is computed from the disparities of vertically local neighbourhood pixels. The major advantage is the feasibility of the pipeline processing on image processing hardware for stereo camera. The direct advantage on processing time is confirmed based on implementation into FPGA. Experimental result also shows that the accuracy of the proposed method is better than the conventional method.},

	abstract = {High accuracy pedestrian detection plays an important role in all intelligent vehicles. This paper describes a system for detecting the obstacles in front of the vehicle and classifying them in pedestrians and non-pedestrians. It acquires the traffic scenes using a low-cost pair of gray intensities stereo cameras. A SORT-SGM stereo-reconstruction technique is used in order to obtain high density and accuracy in stereo-reconstructed points. First, the road plane is computed using the V disparity map and then the obstacles are determined by analyzing the U disparity map. Size related and histogram of oriented gradient based on gray levels features are used for describing each pedestrian hypothesis. A principle component analysis on the features is used for their selection and projection in a relevant space. Different SVM classifiers are trained considering the relevant features on large pedestrian and non-pedestrian image sets. A comparison between them is finally performed for selecting the one that achieves the best classification score.},
